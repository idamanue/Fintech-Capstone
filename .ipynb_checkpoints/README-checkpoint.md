# Solar Metrics: NOCT Precision

## Unlock the Power of Savings with NOCT: Harnessing Accurate Calculations for Solar Modules!!!

SolarMetrics is a cutting-edge fintech project that aims to address the current challenges in calculating the NOCT (Nominal Operating Cell Temperature) for solar modules. The existing procedure for determining NOCT lacks repeatability, leading to inconsistent results. Our project focuses on developing a robust tool that utilizes linear regression and other machine learning techniques to process solar data accurately and determine NOCT values. By comparing our results with the existing procedure, we aim to showcase the improved precision and reliability of our approach.


* Executive summary of the project

    SolarMetrics is a modern financial technology (fintech) project that aims to solve the current challenges associated with calculating the Nominal Operating Cell Temperature (NOCT) for solar modules. The NOCT is an important parameter used in determining the performance and efficiency of solar panels.

    
* The Problem we are trying to resolve

    The existing procedure for determining NOCT lacks repeatability, which means that it often produces inconsistent results. This inconsistency can be problematic for solar panel manufacturers, installers, and investors who rely on accurate data to make informed decisions.
    By comparing the results obtained from SolarMetrics with those from the existing procedure, the project aims to demonstrate the improved precision and reliability of its approach. This comparison will help validate the effectiveness of SolarMetrics in accurately calculating NOCT values for solar modules.



* The Solar Metrics Solution

    * Include any relevant code or demonstrations of the analysis or application.

    * The SolarMetrics project focuses on developing a robust tool that utilizes advanced techniques such as linear regression and machine learning to process solar data accurately and determine NOCT values. Linear regression is a statistical method that helps identify relationships between variables, while machine learning algorithms can analyze large amounts of data to make predictions or classifications.
